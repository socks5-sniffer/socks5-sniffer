# Hi there, I'm an Aspiring Solutions Architect 👋

I am a technical integrator and aspiring **Solutions Architect** focused on bridging the gap between business needs and deployed infrastructure.

I specialize in **AI-Augmented Engineering**—utilizing Generative AI to rapidly prototype, secure, and deploy applications without getting bogged down in syntax. My workflow prioritizes **architecture, security, and speed**.

Most recently, I have moved from standard web development to **Enterprise Linux** and **Containerization**, successfully deploying containerized applications to the **Red Hat OpenShift** environment.

## 🚀 Current Focus: The Pivot to Red Hat
I am aggressively upskilling to transition into the Red Hat ecosystem.
* **Infrastructure:** Deploying ephemeral pods and services in the **Red Hat Developer Sandbox**.
* **Orchestration:** Moving from local hosting to understanding Kubernetes/OpenShift architecture.
* **Philosophy:** Adopting the "Upstream First" and Open Source mindset.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Toolkit

| Category | Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure** | **Red Hat OpenShift**, Linux (RHEL/Fedora), Apache, Hostinger |
| **Languages** | Python, PHP, HTML (AI-Assisted implementation) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL, Firebase |
| **Security** | Cloudflare (DNS/WAF), Argon2id Hashing, Cybersecurity Cert (In Progress) |
| **AI Tools** | Prompt Engineering for rapid code generation & debugging |

## 🛡️ Security-First Methodology
Even in rapid prototyping, I adhere to strict security practices:
* **Input Sanitization:** Prepared statements and strict type checking on all forms.
* **Secrets Management:** API keys are stored in Environment Variables (never hardcoded).
* **Dependency Scanning:** Automated checks for vulnerable packages via Dependabot.
* **Least Privilege:** Ensuring services run with minimum necessary permissions.
