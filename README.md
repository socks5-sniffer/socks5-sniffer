## Hi there 👋


**socks5-sniffer/socks5-sniffer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


My focus other than fun projects will generally revolve around access control, API Security, and Data Protection.  Other security practices executed to keep the code safe and stable include:

Safe Input Handling:
All user input is checked and sanitized. For example, database queries use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection.

No Secrets in Code:
API keys and passwords are stored in environment variables or GitHub Secrets, never in the repo.

Dependency Safety:
The projects use tools like Dependabot to watch for vulnerable packages.

Protected Workflow:
Important branches require reviews before merging to prevent unwanted changes.
