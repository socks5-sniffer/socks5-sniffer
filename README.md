## Hi there 👋


**socks5-sniffer/socks5-sniffer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

# 🏗️ After the military and construction beat me up, I am hanging my tool belt up for some lumbar support and a cool coffee mug.  

Newly budding dveloper with an interest in security.  I started out curious on how passwords were salted/ hashed and...well I kept reading.  

genAI is helping me through the giant hurdles that held me back from learing to code before, and I am so thankful for it.  

Reach out at let me know what I am doing wrong and I will thank you big!



## 🔒 Never Change Security Notes

My projects focus on access control, API Security, and Data Protection.  Other security practices executed to keep the code safe and stable include:

Safe Input Handling:
All user input is checked and sanitized. For example, database queries use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection.

No Secrets in Code:
API keys and passwords are stored in environment variables or GitHub Secrets, never in the repo.

Dependency Safety:
The project uses tools like Dependabot to watch for vulnerable packages.

Protected Workflow:
Important branches require reviews before merging to prevent unwanted changes.
